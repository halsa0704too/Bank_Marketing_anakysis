# **Bank Marketing Campaign Analysis**

## **Project Overview**

This project involves the analysis of a marketing campaign dataset from a Portuguese bank. The goal is to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit based on various demographic, social, and economic factors. The analysis includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and building classification models to predict the likelihood of subscription.

The key objectives of this project are:
1. Understand the factors influencing client subscription.
2. Build predictive models to identify potential customers.
3. Provide actionable insights to improve campaign success rates.

## **Dataset**

The dataset contains information collected during direct telemarketing campaigns conducted by the bank. It includes the following types of data:
- **Client Information**: Age, job, marital status, education, etc.
- **Campaign Details**: Number of contacts, days since last contact, previous campaign outcomes, etc.
- **Economic Indicators**: Employment variation rate, consumer price index, etc.
- **Target Variable**: Whether the client subscribed to the term deposit (`yes` or `no`).

The dataset is available in the `data/` directory as `bank.csv`.

## **Steps in Analysis**

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing values.
   - Encode categorical variables using one-hot encoding and label encoding.
   - Normalize or scale numerical features.

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualize distributions of key features (e.g., age, job, marital status).
   - Analyze correlations between features.
   - Examine the relationship between independent variables and the target variable (`subscribed`).

### 3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Create new features based on domain knowledge (e.g., categorize age groups).
   - Select the most relevant features using correlation analysis and feature importance from models.

### 4. **Model Training**
   - Train classification models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.
   - Use train-test split and cross-validation for evaluation.
   - Optimize hyperparameters using grid search.

### 5. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluate models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.
   - Compare model performance to select the best model.

## **Results and Insights**

- **Key Factors Influencing Subscription:**
  - Features such as **duration of contact**, **number of contacts in the campaign**, and **previous campaign outcome** strongly influence the likelihood of subscription.
  - Socioeconomic factors like employment variation rate and consumer confidence index also play a role.

- **Best Performing Model:**
  - The **Random Forest Classifier** achieved the highest accuracy and AUC-ROC score, making it the best model for predicting subscription likelihood.

- **Recommendations:**
  - Focus on clients with positive outcomes in previous campaigns.
  - Optimize the timing and duration of calls.
  - Target specific demographic groups based on their likelihood to subscribe.
